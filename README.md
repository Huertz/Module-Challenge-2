## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
My motivation for this project was to build my first porfolio while also understanding the concepts of HTML and CSS. 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I builded the project becuase I wanted to undestnad HTML and CSS. Also to have aunderttanding of webdige. To be able to have a orgnaize website, the design should be planned before starting 
to right the code. It helps to have a final picture of the website. 
- What problem does it solve?
The project solved many problems. The most dificult time that I had was with the Project Section. I did manage to figure out, but I know I can do better. 
- What did you learn?
I learned how HTML and CSS interacts with each other. I still have few problems but, but I know with practices I get better making websites and unsertanding the concepts of flexbox. 
I know that the website looks simple but I think it does what it supposedly needs to do.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
